## 🛠️ INSTALL (0 IQ SPEEDRUN)

1. Smash the green **Code → Download ZIP** button or `git clone` like a keyboard warrior.  
2. Yeet every file into ONE (1) folder – folder inception = bad juju.  
3. Double-click **`index.html`**.  
4. Browser opens → bass drops → goosebumps.  
5. If step 4 doesn't happen, blame mercury retrograde (or clear cache).

> **pro tip**: Works offline because PWA magic – flex on your commute with *no bars*.
