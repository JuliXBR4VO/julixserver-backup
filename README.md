## 🚀 WHY THE FUCK DOES THIS EXIST?

Because silence is for pussy-ass bitches and we're too broke/smart to pay for Spotify Premium like some corporate cocksuckers.  
`julixserver` rams beats straight into your fucking eardrums with zero ads, zero fucks given, and 100% pure uncut dopamine, you beautiful bastard.

1. Smash that green **Code → Download ZIP** button like it owes you money, or `git clone` if you're some tryhard neckbeard.  
2. Dump all this shit into ONE (1) fucking folder – nested folders are for psychopaths and war criminals.  
3. Double-click **`index.html`** like you're clicking on your ex's new relationship status.  
4. Browser opens → bass fucking OBLITERATES your speakers → nipples get hard.  
5. If step 4 doesn't happen, it's because you're a disappointment to your parents (or just clear your goddamn cache, dipshit).

> **pro tip**: This shit works offline because PWA sorcery – flex on peasants with *no fucking signal*.
